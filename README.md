<br>
Welcome to my portfolio showcasing my solutions to the problem sets from the <B>6-100A+B Introduction to CS and Programming using Python</B> courses. I took these classes while a ago and they were so benefitial for my careear! The solutions presented here are intended for educational purposes, demonstrating my proficiency in Python programming.

<b>Please note:</b> While these solutions are available for review, it's essential to uphold academic integrity and refrain from direct copying. These courses serve as foundational knowledge for those interested in Data Science, playing a pivotal role in shaping one's professional development within this field. Your understanding of these concepts and their application is crucial for success! 

### 6-100A Problem Set 1

It involves calculating the time needed to save for a house down payment based on variables like salary, savings rate, and investment returns. Additionally, it explores incorporating semi-annual raises into the calculations and introduces the use of bisection search to find the optimal interest rate for achieving a down payment within a specified time frame. 

### 6-100A Problem Set 2

It is a Hangman game: he computer selecting a secret word, and the player guessing letters to reveal the word.

### 6-100A Problem Set 3

It is designed to compare the similarity between two texts or documents. This is achieved through two different methods: using word frequencies and using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) of words in the documents.

### 6-100A Problem Set 4

It explores recursion, trees, classes, and cryptography. There are tree structures, heights,  heaps, and encrypting and decrypting messages using one-time pads. The final step combines everything to decode an encrypted story.

### 6-100A Problem Set 5

It uses Python's Image Library (PIL) for image processing, creating functions to convert images, apply color filters, and transform them. It also focuses on steganography, where there are secret images within images.
