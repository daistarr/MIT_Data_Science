### 6-100A Problem Set 1

It involves calculating the time needed to save for a house down payment based on variables like salary, savings rate, and investment returns. Additionally, it explores incorporating semi-annual raises into the calculations and introduces the use of bisection search to find the optimal interest rate for achieving a down payment within a specified time frame. 

### 6-100A Problem Set 2

It is a Hangman game: he computer selecting a secret word, and the player guessing letters to reveal the word.

### 6-100A Problem Set 3

It is designed to compare the similarity between two texts or documents. This is achieved through two different methods: using word frequencies and using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) of words in the documents.

### 6-100A Problem Set 4

It explores recursion, trees, classes, and cryptography. There are tree structures, heights,  heaps, and encrypting and decrypting messages using one-time pads. The final step combines everything to decode an encrypted story.

### 6-100A Problem Set 5

It uses Python's Image Library (PIL) for image processing, creating functions to convert images, apply color filters, and transform them. It also focuses on steganography, where there are secret images within images.

### 6-100B Problem Set 1

It focuses on analyzing election results to identify the minimal voter count required for altering election outcomes by redistributing voters across states. This involves loading election data, creating helper functions, and exploring brute-force and dynamic programming methods for voter reassignment. The dynamic programming approach solves the complementary knapsack problem, pinpointing the best swing states for outcome alteration while minimizing voter movement.

### 6-100B Problem Set 2

It creates data structures for directed graphs, using Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to find optimal paths, and applying computing and data analysis to real-world road navigation problems. The problem set involves tasks such as creating a graph representation, building a road network, finding the shortest path using DFS, and considering various scenarios like traffic conditions and restricted roads.

### 6-100B Problem Set 3

It focuses on simulating robot movement and cleaning in a room. Robots with different behavior types are implemented using classes. The simulation analyzes how long each robot type takes to clean a room, involving concepts such as movement strategies, dropped dust, sensors, and data analysis through simulations and plots.

### 6-100B Problem Set 4

It involves creating a Monte Carlo simulation to assess flood damage from rising sea levels over decades, considering strategies like 'prepare', 'repair', and 'retreat'. The simulation aids in decision-making for coastal regions, where flooding risks pose economic challenges. It estimates sea level rise distributions, calculates damage costs, and compares prevention strategies' effects on overall costs using simulations.


### 6-100B Problem Set 5

It models temperature changes over time using regression analysis and NCEI data. It generates graphs, performs trend modeling and evaluation. It is based on linear and polynomial regression; assessing accuracy using metrics, predicting future temperatures, and evaluating predictions using test data.
